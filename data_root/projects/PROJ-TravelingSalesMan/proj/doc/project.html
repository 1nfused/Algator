    The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem, studied as far back as the 1800s. The traveling salesman problem involves finding the most efficient route through a collection of cities, visiting each city exactly once. The traveling salesman problem is often described in terms of optimizing a route through a collection of cities; however, the traveling salesman problem can be applied to other applications. For example, the notion of cities can be thought of as customers for certain applications, or even as soldering points on a microchip. The idea of distance can also be revised to consider other constraints such as time.
